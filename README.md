# Garrison's Miscellaneous Kotlin Multiplatform Libraries

This is a random collection of KMP libraries that I work on for fun. This repo has
existed as a private repo for years at this point, but I've hesitated to make it
public because of a) the hacky nature of most of this work b) the lack of tests and
c) the lack of documentation. I've decided to make it public anyway, and will try to
improve the documentation, testing, and processes (e.g. put my work into PRs like a proper
human) in the near future to make more of these libraries production ready. In the meantime,
use the below table to get a sense of what is and isn't ready for the limelight (note that some
of these are not hosted in this repo):

# Future Improvements
This monorepo primarily exists as a sandbox where I can avoid dealing with things like CI/CD, Maven repos,
and PRs when I'm coding for fun, so it's unlikely that I'll *completely* switch over to the
proper way of developing with branches and PRs anytime soon.

That being said, I want some of these libraries to be production ready in the future. To that end,
I'm going to try to do the following moving forward to make this repo less of a mess (last updated 1/5/24):
[ ] a `main` branch will be created with any releases, and only functioning code will be pushed to that branch after it is created
[ ] GitHub releases for each new library version
[ ] my "stream of consciousness" coding of random commits to random libraries whenever I feel like it will occur in a new `dev` branch
[ ] for libraries that I have given the status "production ready" in the table above, I'll make proper branches and PRs for all updates
[ ] start uploading new release to maven central
 - all releases are currently sent out to my personal private maven repository, so it's hard for anyone but me to use anything in this repo
[ ] simple CI/CD for publishing all of the libraries using GitHub Actions
[ ] revamp of the convention plugins so they can be published
